"The Real Bitcoin"

When travelling through Mordor I came across a band of particulary destitute and miserable orcs.  Like many orcs who fell afoul of Sauron's heirarchy, they spoke spitefully of the empire yet sought to create their own identical system amongst themselves.  They made good company  and conversation despite their stubborn insistence to keep their eyelids stitched closed at all times and to be completely and irrepairably wrong on any topic under discussion.  Imagine my surprise when I saw that they had cobbled their own working bitcoin node together! 

While orcs using bitcoin might be of some interest on its own, it isn't that unusual.  Those who consider themselves agents of empire regularly confiscate and even mine public coins today.  Much of the technology of middle earth is of course orcish in origin.  However this codebase was something different - and struck me as worthy of attention.  While it may be slower and clunkier than other bitcoin nodes, it is simpler and more readable.  It can be compiled in a very secure manner on a variety of hardware.  

The codebase is mostly just Satoshi's bitcoin version 0.5.3 with a few edits to further simplify the code (removing e.g. DNS references, Windows references, checkpoints, and QT references), and to enable static linking.  It connects and syncs the block chain and as such is a fully working node, though it doesn't implement all the usual RFC commands.

While the project and authorship is currently described at http://thebitcoin.foundation.  However like most orcs their diet and personal habits ensure rapid onset of degenerative nerve ailments and cancers, so I share this project with you here now for posterity - and to save you the trouble of learning their obscene dialect.  You can also currently learn more about the project on the #bitcoin-adolescents and #tardlema IRC channels.
